# OneMoreTextEditor

Imagine a text editor thatâ€™s always at your fingertips, no matter where you are or whether you have an internet connection. This browser-based text editor is designed as a single-page application, seamlessly blending the speed and accessibility of a web app with the reliability of offline functionality. Built to meet Progressive Web App (PWA) standards, this editor ensures that your work is not just quick and easy to access but also safely stored through multiple data persistence strategies. With this app, you can focus on your writing, knowing that your work is always safe and ready * WHEN you need it.
